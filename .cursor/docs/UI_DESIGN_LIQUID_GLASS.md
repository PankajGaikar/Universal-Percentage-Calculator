# Liquid Glass UI (Glassmorphism) – SwiftUI

## Principles
- Translucent panels with `.background(.ultraThinMaterial)` and layered blur.
- Elevated glass cards (rounded 20–28, subtle shadow).
- Bold, legible typography. Dynamic Type friendly.
- Satisfying haptics at key increments (e.g., 5%, 10%, 25%).

## Components
- **GlassCard**: Container for forms/results.
- **PercentSlider**: Slider + numeric field sync.
- **ResultBadge**: Prominent formatted output.
- **SimpleBarChart**: Swift Charts or custom path-based chart.

## Accessibility
- Ensure contrast over materials.
- VoiceOver labels for sliders and results.
